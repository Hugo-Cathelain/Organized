# Organised — UNIX Semester 1

A C programming project focused on implementing sorting systems and filtering mechanisms. This project demonstrates fundamental algorithms and data manipulation techniques as part of the UNIX module curriculum.

## About

This project explores sorting algorithms and data filtering in C, providing hands-on experience with:
- Various sorting implementations (bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, etc.)
- Data filtering and search algorithms
- Memory management and efficient data structures
- File I/O operations for data processing

## Features

- Multiple sorting algorithm implementations
- Configurable filtering options for data sets
- Optimized performance for large data processing
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Modular code structure for easy extension
